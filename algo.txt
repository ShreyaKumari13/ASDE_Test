Algorithm

1. Initialization:

Let p be Abhimanyu's initial power.
Let k = [k1, k2, ..., k11] be an array representing the power of enemies in each circle.
Let a be the number of skips available.
Let b be the number of recharges available.

2. Traverse each circle:

For each circle i from 1 to 11:
    -Check if Abhimanyu can skip:
        If a > 0, decrement a and continue to the next circle without battling.
    -Battle the enemy:
        If p >= k[i], Abhimanyu wins the battle and loses k[i] power.
        If p < k[i], Abhimanyu loses the battle, and the algorithm terminates with failure.
    -Regeneration condition:
        If Abhimanyu is at circle 4 (i == 4) and k3 enemy is regenerated:
            k3 will attack with half its initial power from behind. If p < k3/2, Abhimanyu loses the battle; otherwise, Abhimanyu loses k3/2 power.
        If Abhimanyu is at circle 8 (i == 8) and k7 enemy is regenerated:
            k7 will attack with half its initial power from behind. If p < k7/2, Abhimanyu loses the battle; otherwise, Abhimanyu loses k7/2 power.
    -Recharge if needed:
        If Abhimanyu's power is too low (optional check, not strictly needed):
            If b > 0, recharge p with a predefined value (or recharging could reset power to a certain level). Decrement b.
Final check:

    If Abhimanyu survives all 11 circles, return "Success".
    Otherwise, return "Failure".
